We will call this language "Il Maestro".
The Concept: "Il Maestro" 🇮🇹🎵

The language is designed around an Italian Opera.

    The Program is a performance.

    Classes are opera (Operas).

    Functions are aria (Solos/Songs).

    The Main Block is the finale (The Grand Finale).

    Output (Print) is canta (Sing).

The Data Types (The Voices):

    int → basso (The deep, solid integer numbers).

    float → soprano (The high, floating notes).

    string → libretto (The text/script).

    bool → verita (The truth).

    void → silenzio (Silence/Void).

The Logic:

    if → se

    while → durante (During)

    true / false → vero / falso
